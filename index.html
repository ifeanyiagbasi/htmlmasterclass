    <h2>How do I love thee?</h2>
    <p>Let me count the ways.
        I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
        My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
        For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
        I love thee to the level of every day's</p>

    <p>Most quiet need, by sun and candlelight.
        I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
        I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
        I love with a passion put to use</p>

    <p>In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
        I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
        With my lost saints, - I love thee with the breath,
        Smiles, tears, of all my life! - and, if God choose,
        I shall but love thee better after death.</p>
